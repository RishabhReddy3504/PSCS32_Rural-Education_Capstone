### Conversation 2: Subject Understanding
```
You: I don't understand photosynthesis

Rishka:
Let me break down photosynthesis for you:

What is Photosynthesis?
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert 
sunlight into chemical energy (glucose).

Simple Formula:
CO₂ + H₂O + Sunlight → Glucose + Oxygen

Where does it happen?
- Location: Leaves of plants
- Organ: Chloroplasts
- Green pigment: Chlorophyll

Two Main Stages:

1. Light Reaction (Needs Light)
   - Occurs in thylakoid membrane
   - Produces ATP and NADPH
   - Releases oxygen
   
2. Dark Reaction (Calvin Cycle)
   - Occurs in stroma
   - Uses ATP and NADPH
   - Produces glucose

Think of it as:
Plants eat sunlight and make their own food!

Need help with any specific part?
